    "description": """In Vendor bill a post-dated cheque is a cheque written by the supplier(payer) for a date in the future. Whether a post-dated cheque may be cashed or deposited before the date written on it depends on the country. Currently, odoo does not provide any kind of feature to manage post-dated cheque.
